goals:

    create a sandwich button which slides in a menu on the left
        this menu contains options for other screens to go to,
        and highlights which menu is current (disabled button)

    a common app bar on the top of the UI
        sandwich button | current song title/artist | play/pause
        display current song at HALF default font size, with
        artist stacked on top of title.
        At first, just display text "artist/title", update signals later.

    create a widget with buttons for all of the different screens
        use an icon instead of words
        place at the top of every screen
        eventually, the home screen may not be needed at all.
            this depends on how many screens I have

    Home Screen provides access to different menu layouts
        Home screen is now a pop in / overlay widget
        Now Playing:
            displays a list of songs in the now playing playlist
            displays controls for volume, current song progress, etc

        Library:
            tree view list of songs in the library
            filters can be applied to search within library
                these may not be needed
            select all select none button
            create playlist button.
                this should go to another screen
                providing additional options for creating the playlist.

        Playlists
            predefined user created playlists that list songs in order
            I have no use for this, so it is wishlisted.

        Presets
            user defined filters which create dynamic playlists

notes:
    multi touch emulation causes orange dots to appear on right click for
    some platforms
